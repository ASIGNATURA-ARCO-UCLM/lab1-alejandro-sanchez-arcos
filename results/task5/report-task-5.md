# Report task 5

**5- Identifica las características clave de los sistemas sobre los  que has ejecutado los análisis (procesador, memoria, caché...) y  relacionalos con los resultados analizados** 

When we run the  program in <u>devcloud</u> there are **24 logical CPU cores** and the frequency is  **3,4 GHz**, whereas in our <u>local computer</u> we have **4 logical CPU cores** and  the frequency **2,7 GHz**, consequently we obtain <u>better time and  performance using devcloud</u> as we have concluded in the previous question.

On the other hand, in our computer we have cache memories and in remote just the main one. Having more memories in local, reduces the  cache misses and is why our computer obtains better results in terms of  memory.

### Questions and Critical thoughts:

Seeing this results we came up with the idea if it was better to do a first run of the program in our own device or in remote devcloud enviroment. We think that depends on the performance of  computer users but we also believe that is too hard to match an equal number of cores in normal computers.
